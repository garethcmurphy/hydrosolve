## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- Python 3.8+  
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`  

Install dependencies:  
pip install numpy matplotlib  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/1d-hydro-solver.git  
cd 1d-hydro-solver  

2. Install required dependencies:
